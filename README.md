**Git** is a version control system for tracking code changes locally. 

**GitHub** is a web platform that hosts Git repositories and adds collaboration and project management features in the cloud.

1. ## What is Version Control?

> **Version Control:** is software used to track and manage changes in code, facilitating collaboration among developers and providing a history of code changes. 

2. ### What is cloning in Git?

> **clone** *in Git means* making a local copy of a remote code repository for editing and collaboration.
> Get Clone is a command that is going to take the repository that you copied the link with the green code button on GitHub.

3. ### What is the command to track and stage files?

 The command to track and stage files in Git with the name of the file you want to stage.
> 1. single file: git add file
> 2. all files: Track all files in a repository by using the following command:
$ git add *

4. ### What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?
 
  > ## commit 

> The command to take a snapshot of changed files in Git is: ***git commit***
This command will create a commit with the changes you've staged. Each time we save a changed version of a project called commit, Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

5. ### What is the command to send your changed files to GitHub?
> **git push**  Push: Share changes with the remote repository. 
This is a common workflow in Git for tracking code changes and collaborating with others.
